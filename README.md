# Pink-Tax
A Java program that shows the pink tax that a user paid on a shopping trip. In the program "simulates" a shopping experience by allowing the user to pick items to add to their cart, checkout, and see the receipt for their purchases.

The term pink tax is based on the observation that products targeted to women are more expensive than products targeted to men. I wanted to expose this gender-based inequality by creating a program that would calculate the pink tax on a typical woman's shopping trip. All the product data in the program is taken from the 2015 New York Department of Consumer Affairs report titled,"From Cradle to Cane", on the gender-base price discrimination in New York City.

When the user starts the program, they are prompted to choose what state they are shopping in. This is done in order to correctly calculate the total price for the shopping trip base on a state's sales tax, but also to know whether or not to include sales tax on feminine hygiene products. As of now, 13 states and the District of Columbia exempt feminine hygiene products from their sales tax (Some of these 13 states don't have sales tax).
